## Installation

### Using Go
```bash
go install github.com/jabzq/Gosniffer@latest
```

### Using Git 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jabzq/Gosniffer.git
cd Gosniffer
go build -o gosniffer main.go        # Unix/Linux/Mac
go build -o gosniffer.exe            # Windows
```

### Usage

#### Basic scan
```bash
go run main.go -h google.com -p 80,443 -t 2s
```

#### Advanced Scan with All Features
```bash
./gosniffer -h target.com -p 1-1000 -b -v -os
```

#### Full Port Range with Security Checks
```bash
./gosniffer -h example.com -p 21,22,23,25,53,80,110,143,443,993,995,3389 -b -v -os
```

### Examples

#### Basic Service Detection
```bash
$ go run main.go -h kali.org -p 1-1000

Scanning kali.org (Ports: 1-1000)...

[+] Port 80 open (HTTP)
[+] Port 53 open (DNS) 
[+] Port 443 open (HTTPS)
```

#### Advanced Scan with All Features
```bash
$ ./gosniffer -h uol.com -p 80,443 -b -v -os

Scanning uol.com (Ports: 80,443)...
Mode: connect | Banner: true | VulnCheck: true | OS Detection: true

[+] Port 80 open (HTTP Server)
    â””â”€â”€ Banner: HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently | Server: CloudFront | Date: ...
    â””â”€â”€ OS: Windows (70% accuracy)
    â””â”€â”€ Vulnerabilities: Web scan recommended (directories, technologies)
[+] Port 443 open (HTTP Server)
    â””â”€â”€ Banner: HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request | Server: CloudFront | Date: ...
    â””â”€â”€ OS: Windows (70% accuracy)
    â””â”€â”€ Vulnerabilities: Web scan recommended (directories, technologies)

Scan completed in 227ms
2 ports scanned, 2 open ports found
```
